Toy implementation of CKKS Homomorphic Encryption

Just wanted to code up my own toy implementation of CKKS Homomorphic Encryption.
Loosely following the below explanatory blog posts, which themselves include Python implementations for intuition (though I am writing this implementation myself without referencing theirs)
